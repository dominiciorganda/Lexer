# Lexer
A  JFLEX specification containing the regular expressions corresponding to a language specification. The lexer produces an output table containing the number of found tokens, identifiers, constants, keywords and operators. The lexer also prints the set of identifiers, keywords and literals and reports lexical errors, specifying the location in the source code file.
